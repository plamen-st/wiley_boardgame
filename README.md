Python Board Game

Objective and Rules:

The objective of the game is to start from safe place and progress around the board until you reach the winning position spot.

Players roll dice to decide moves, the dice consists of values 1-3.

When a player is in reach of the winning position, they require a perfect roll to move to winning position, any value greater than or less than will mean they maintain position.

When a player lands on a square that is the same value as another player, the player that was already on the position is killed and reset back to the safe place.
